Dockerize is an Elixir hex package that helps you create [Docker] images from an Elixir project.

## Install

```sh
mix archive.install github qhwa/dockerize
```
## Getting Started

#### Initialize configurations

Configurations can be generated by the `dockerize.init` task.

Run in your project directory:

```sh
mix dockerize.init
```

This command generates configurations for your project, including the `Dockerfile`.

##### use different app name other the directory name

By default, it guess the app is the same as directory name. If not, you can specify `--app` argument:

```sh
mix dockerize.init --app my_app
```

#### Build your docker image

just run `docker build`, for example

```sh
docker build .
```

For more information of `docker build`, please refer to the [official document](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

##### use MIX_ENV other than `prod`

By default, it build the image with `MIX_ENV=prod`. You can change `MIX_ENV` value by providing it as an build argument:

```sh
docker build --build-arg mix_env=dev .
```

#### use HEX_MIRROR other than default (https://repo.hex.pm)

If you are in China, you may want to use some hex mirror:

```sh
docker build --build-arg hex_mirror_url=https://hexpm.upyun.com .
```

### For Phoenix Projects

Modify the generated `Dockerfile` follow the instruction in it.


## Docker images underhood

There are two base docker used:

* [elixir-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/qhwa/elixir-runner) provide a final environment for running your release. This image is based on [Alpine] which is a very minimum Linux distribution.
* [elixir-builder](https://hub.docker.com/r/qhwa/elixir-builder) is used for building the final minimum docker image to distribute.
